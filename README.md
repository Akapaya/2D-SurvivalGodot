# Godot Project: 2D Survival

Welcome to my Godot repository, where I share my project developed as part of my studies. This project is a Godot challenge, Creating a 2D game inspired by Vampire Survivors.

## Project description

### 2D Survival
The game is based on the idea of Vampire Survivors, where in a top-down mode the player moves to escape the enemies that appear around the scene, while he automatically shoots the enemies.
